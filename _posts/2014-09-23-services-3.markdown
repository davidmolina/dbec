ODOT is compiling a list of companies interested in working on road, highway and bridge projects. This includes any construction, engineering and design, trucking, and materials supply on highway, road, bridge and related projects for both state and local governments. The list, being compiled in May and June through phone surveys and an online survey, will serve as a resource for the departmentâ€™s update to its disparity study.[Take the survey](http://odotdbestudy.org/)
